# Ariadne Code Generator

Python code generator that takes graphql schema, queries, mutations and subscriptions and generates Python package with fully typed and asynchronous GraphQL client.

It's available as `ariadne-codegen` command and reads configuration from the `pyproject.toml` file:

```
$ ariadne-codegen
```

It can also be run as `python -m ariadne_codegen`.


## Features

- Generate pydantic models from schema types, inputs and enums.
- Generate pydantic models for GraphQL results.
- Generate client package with each GraphQL operation available as async method.


## Installation

Ariadne Code Generator can be installed with pip:

```
$ pip install ariadne-codegen
```

To support subscriptions, default base client requires `websockets` package:

```
$ pip install ariadne-codegen[subscriptions]
```


## Configuration

`ariadne-codegen` reads configuration from `[tool.ariadne-codegen]` section in your `pyproject.toml`. You can use other configuration file with `--config` option, eg. `ariadne-codegen --config custom_file.toml`

Minimal configuration for client generation:

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen]
schema_path = "schema.graphql"
queries_path = "queries.graphql"
```

Required settings:

- `queries_path` - path to file/directory with queries (Can be optional if `enable_custom_operations` is used)

One of the following 2 parameters is required, in case of providing both of them `schema_path` is prioritized:

- `schema_path` - path to file/directory with graphql schema
- `remote_schema_url` - url to graphql server, where introspection query can be perfomed

Optional settings:

- `remote_schema_headers` - extra headers that are passed along with introspection query, eg. `{"Authorization" = "Bearer: token"}`. To include an environment variable in a header value, prefix the variable with `$`, eg. `{"Authorization" = "$AUTH_TOKEN"}`
- `remote_schema_verify_ssl` (defaults to `true`) - a flag that specifies wheter to verify ssl while introspecting remote schema
- `target_package_name` (defaults to `"graphql_client"`) - name of generated package
- `target_package_path` (defaults to cwd) - path where to generate package
- `client_name` (defaults to `"Client"`) - name of generated client class
- `client_file_name` (defaults to `"client"`) - name of file with generated client class
- `base_client_name` (defaults to `"AsyncBaseClient"`) - name of base client class
- `base_client_file_path` (defaults to `.../ariadne_codegen/client_generators/dependencies/async_base_client.py`) - path to file where `base_client_name` is defined
- `enums_module_name` (defaults to `"enums"`) - name of file with generated enums models
- `input_types_module_name` (defaults to `"input_types"`) - name of file with generated input types models
- `fragments_module_name` (defaults to `"fragments"`) - name of file with generated fragments models
- `include_comments` (defaults to `"stable"`) - option which sets content of comments included at the top of every generated file. Valid choices are: `"none"` (no comments), `"timestamp"` (comment with generation timestamp), `"stable"` (comment contains a message that this is a generated file)
- `convert_to_snake_case` (defaults to `true`) - a flag that specifies whether to convert fields and arguments names to snake case
- `include_all_inputs` (defaults to `true`) - a flag specifying whether to include all inputs defined in the schema, or only those used in supplied operations
- `include_all_enums` (defaults to `true`) - a flag specifying whether to include all enums defined in the schema, or only those used in supplied operations
- `async_client` (defaults to `true`) - default generated client is `async`, change this to option `false` to generate synchronous client instead
- `opentelemetry_client` (defaults to `false`) - default base clients don't support any performance tracing. Change this option to `true` to use the base client with Open Telemetry support.
- `files_to_include` (defaults to `[]`) - list of files which will be copied into generated package
- `plugins` (defaults to `[]`) - list of plugins to use during generation
- `enable_custom_operations` (defaults to `false`) - enables building custom operations. Generates additional files that contains all the classes and methods for generation.


## Custom operation builder

The custom operation builder allows you to create complex GraphQL queries in a structured and intuitive way. 

### Example Code

```python
import asyncio
from graphql_client import Client
from graphql_client.custom_fields import (
    ProductFields,
    ProductTranslatableContentFields,
    ProductTranslationFields,
    TranslatableItemConnectionFields,
    TranslatableItemEdgeFields,
)
from graphql_client.custom_queries import Query
from graphql_client.enums import LanguageCodeEnum, TranslatableKinds


async def get_products():
    # Create a client instance with the specified URL and headers
    client = Client(
        url="https://saleor.cloud/graphql/",
        headers={"authorization": "bearer ..."},
    )

    # Build the queries
    product_query = Query.product(id="...", channel="channel-uk").fields(
        ProductFields.id,
        ProductFields.name,
    )

    translation_query = Query.translations(kind=TranslatableKinds.PRODUCT, first=10).fields(
        TranslatableItemConnectionFields.edges().alias("aliased_edges").fields(
            TranslatableItemEdgeFields.node.on(
                "ProductTranslatableContent",
                ProductTranslatableContentFields.id,
                ProductTranslatableContentFields.product_id,
                ProductTranslatableContentFields.name,
            )
        )
    )

    # Execute the queries with an operation name
    response = await client.query(
        product_query,
        translation_query,
        operation_name="get_products",
    )

    print(response)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(get_products())
```

### Explanation


1. Building the Product Query:
   1. The Query.product(id="...", channel="channel-uk") initiates a query for a product with the specified ID and channel.
   2. .fields(ProductFields.id, ProductFields.name) specifies the fields to retrieve for the product: id and name.
2. Building the Translation Query:
   1. The Query.translations(kind=TranslatableKinds.PRODUCT, first=10) initiates a query for product translations.
   2. .fields(...) specifies the fields to retrieve for the translations.
   3. .alias("aliased_edges") renames the edges field to aliased_edges.
   4. .on("ProductTranslatableContent", ...) specifies the fields to retrieve if the node is of type ProductTranslatableContent: id, product_id, and name.
3. Executing the Queries:
   1. The client.query(...) method is called with the built queries and an operation name "get_products".   
   2. This method sends the queries to the server and retrieves the response.


### Example pyproject.toml configuration. 

`Note: queries_path is optional when enable_custom_operations is set to true`

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen]
schema_path = "schema.graphql"
include_comments = "none"
target_package_name = "example_client"
enable_custom_operations = true
```


## Plugins

Ariadne Codegen implements a plugin system that enables further customization and fine-tuning of generated Python code. It’s documentation is available separately in the [PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen/blob/main/PLUGINS.md) file.


### Standard plugins

Ariadne Codegen ships with optional plugins importable from the `ariadne_codegen.contrib` package:

- [`ariadne_codegen.contrib.shorter_results.ShorterResultsPlugin`](ariadne_codegen/contrib/shorter_results.py) - This plugin processes generated client methods for operations where only single top field is requested, so they return this field's value directly instead of operation's result type. For example get_user method generated for query `GetUser() { user(...) { ... }}` will return value of user field directly instead of `GetUserResult`.

- [`ariadne_codegen.contrib.extract_operations.ExtractOperationsPlugin`](ariadne_codegen/contrib/extract_operations.py) - This extracts query strings from generated client's methods into separate `operations.py` module. It also modifies the generated client to import these definitions. Generated module name can be customized by adding `operations_module_name="custom_name"` to the `[tool.ariadne-codegen.operations]` section in config. Eg.:

    ```toml
    [tool.ariadne-codegen]
    ...
    plugins = ["ariadne_codegen.contrib.extract_operations.ExtractOperationsPlugin"]
    
    [tool.ariadne-codegen.extract_operations]
    operations_module_name = "custom_operations_module_name"
    ```

- [`ariadne_codegen.contrib.client_forward_refs.ClientForwardRefsPlugin`](ariadne_codegen/contrib/client_forward_refs.py) - This plugin changes generated client module moving all Pydantic models imports under the `TYPE_CHECKING` condition, making them forward references. This greatly improves the import performance of the `client` module.

- [`ariadne_codegen.contrib.no_reimports.NoReimportsPlugin`](ariadne_codegen/contrib/no_reimports.py) - This plugin removes content of generated `__init__.py`. This is useful in scenarios where generated plugins contain so many Pydantic models that client's eager initialization of entire package on first import is very slow.


## Using generated client

Generated client can be imported from package:
```py
from {target_package_name}.{client_file_name} import {client_name}
```

Example with default settings:
```py
from graphql_client.client import Client
```

### Passing headers to client

Client (with default base client), takes passed headers and attaches them to every sent request.
```py
client = Client("https://example.com/graphql", {"Authorization": "Bearer token"})
```

For more complex scenarios, you can pass your own http client:
```py
client = Client(http_client=CustomComplexHttpClient())
```

`CustomComplexHttpClient` needs to be an instance of `httpx.AsyncClient` for async client, or `httpx.Client` for sync.


### Websockets

To handle subscriptions, default `AsyncBaseClient` uses [websockets](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets) and implements [graphql-transport-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) subprotocol. Arguments `ws_origin` and `ws_headers` are added as headers to the handshake request and `ws_connection_init_payload` is used as payload of [ConnectionInit](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#connectioninit) message.


### File upload

Default base client (`AsyncBaseClient` or `BaseClient`) checks if any part of `variables` dictionary is an instance of `Upload`. If at least one instance is found then client sends multipart request according to [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

Class `Upload` is included in generated client and can be imported from it: 

```py
from {target_package_name} import Upload
```

By default we use this class to represent graphql scalar `Upload`. For schema with different name for this scalar, you can still use `Upload` and default client for file uploads:

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.OTHERSCALAR]
type = "Upload"
```


### Open Telemetry

When config option `opentelemetry_client` is set to `true` then default, included base client is replaced with one that implements the opt-in Open Telemetry support. By default this support does nothing but when the `opentelemetry-api` package is installed and the `tracer` argument is provided then the client will create spans with data about performed requests.

Tracing arguments handled by `BaseClientOpenTelemetry`:
- `tracer`: `Optional[Union[str, Tracer]] = None` - tracer object or name which will be passed to the `get_tracer` method
- `root_context`: `Optional[Context] = None` - optional context added to root span
- `root_span_name`: `str = "GraphQL Operation"` - name of root span

`AsyncBaseClientOpenTelemetry` supports all arguments which `BaseClientOpenTelemetry` does, but also exposes additional arguments regarding websockets:
- `ws_root_context`: `Optional[Context] = None` - optional context added to root span for websocket connection
- `ws_root_span_name`: `str = "GraphQL Subscription"` - name of root span for websocket connection


## Custom scalars

By default, not built-in scalars are represented as `typing.Any` in generated client.
You can provide information about specific scalar by adding section to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.{graphql scalar name}]
type = "(required) python type name"
serialize = "function used to serialize scalar"
parse = "function used to create scalar instance from serialized form"
```

For each custom scalar client will use given `type` in all occurrences of `{graphql scalar name}`. If provided, `serialize` and `parse` will be used for serialization and deserialization. In result models `type` will be annotated with `BeforeValidator`, eg. `Annotated[type, BeforeValidator(parse)]`. In inputs annotation will use `PlainSerializer`, eg. `Annotated[type, PlainSerializer(serialize)]`.
If `type`/`serialize`/`parse` contains at least one `.` then string will be split by it's last occurrence. First part will be used as module to import from, and second part as type/method name. For example, `type = "custom_scalars.a.ScalarA"` will produce `from custom_scalars.a import ScalarA`.


### Example with scalar mapped to built-in type

In this case scalar is mapped to built-in `str` which doesn't require custom `serialize ` and `parse` methods.

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARA]
type = "str"
```


### Example with type supported by pydantic

In this scenario scalar is represented as `datetime`, so it needs to be imported. Pydantic handles serialization and deserialization so custom `parse` and `serialize` is not necessary.

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.DATETIME]
type = "datetime.datetime"
```

### Example with fully custom type

In this example scalar is represented as class `TypeB`. Pydantic can't handle serialization and deserialization so custom `parse` and `serialize` is necessary. To provide `type`, `parse` and `serialize` implementation we can use `files_to_include` to copy `type_b.py` file.

```toml
[tool.ariadne-codegen]
...
files_to_include = [".../type_b.py"]

[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARB]
type = ".type_b.TypeB"
parse = ".type_b.parse_b"
serialize = ".type_b.serialize_b"
```

```py
# inputs.py

class TestInput(BaseModel):
    value_b: Annotated[TypeB, PlainSerializer(serialize_b)]
```

```py
# get_b.py

class GetB(BaseModel):
    query_b: Annotated[TypeB, BeforeValidator(parse_b)]
```

```py
# client.py

class Client(AsyncBaseClient):
    async def test_mutation(self, value: TypeB) -> TestMutation:
        ...
        variables: Dict[str, object] = {
            "value": serialize_b(value),
        }
        ...
```


## Extending generated types

### Extending models with custom mixins

`mixin` directive allows to extend class generated for query/mutation field with custom logic.
`mixin` takes two required arguments:
- `from` - name of a module to import from
- `import` - name of a parent class

Generated class will use `import` as extra base class, and import will be added to the file.
```py
from {from} import {import}
...
class OperationNameField(BaseModel, {import}):
    ...
```

This directive can be used along with `files_to_include` option to extend functionality of generated classes.


#### Example of usage of `mixin` and `files_to_include`:

Query with `mixin` directive:

```gql
query listUsers {
    users @mixin(from: ".mixins", import: "UsersMixin") {
        id
    }
}
```

Part of `pyproject.toml` with `files_to_include` (`mixins.py` contains `UsersMixin` implementation)
```toml
files_to_include = [".../mixins.py"]
```

Part of generated `list_users.py` file:
```py
...
from .mixins import UsersMixin
...
class ListUsersUsers(BaseModel, UsersMixin):
    ...
```


## Multiple clients

To generate multiple different clients you can store config for each in different file, then provide path to config file by `--config` option, eg.
```
ariadne-codegen --config clientA.toml
ariadne-codegen --config clientB.toml
```


## Generated code dependencies

Generated code requires:

- [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)
- [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx)
- [websockets](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets) (only for default async base client)

Both `httpx` and `websockets` dependencies can be avoided by providing another base client class with `base_client_file_path` and `base_client_name` options.


## Example

Example with simple schema and few queries and mutations is available [here](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen/blob/main/EXAMPLE.md).


## Generating a copy of GraphSQL schema

Instead of generating a client, you can generate a file with a copy of a GraphQL schema. To do this call `ariadne-codegen` with `graphqlschema` argument:

```
ariadne-codegen graphqlschema
```

`graphqlschema` mode reads configuration from the same place as [`client`](#configuration) but uses only `schema_path`, `remote_schema_url`, `remote_schema_headers`, `remote_schema_verify_ssl` options to retrieve the schema and `plugins` option to load plugins.

In addition to the above, `graphqlschema` mode also accepts additional settings specific to it:


### `target_file_path`

A string with destination path for generated file. Must be either a Python (`.py`), or GraphQL (`.graphql` or `.gql`) file.

Defaults to `schema.py`.

Generated Python file will contain:

- Necessary imports
- Type map declaration `{type_map_variable_name}: TypeMap = {...}`
- Schema declaration `{schema_variable_name}: GraphQLSchema = GraphQLSchema(...)`

Generated GraphQL file will contain a formatted output of the `print_schema` function from the `graphql-core` package.


### `schema_variable_name`

A string with a name for schema variable, must be valid python identifier.

Defaults to `"schema"`. Used only if target is a Python file.


### `type_map_variable_name`

A string with a name for type map variable, must be valid python identifier.

Defaults to `"type_map"`. Used only if target is a Python file.
